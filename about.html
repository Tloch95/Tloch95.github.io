        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
           My name is Thomas Lochner. I'm a 24-year-old web developer with a love for technology/coding. I was born and raised in Tucson, AZ and still currently live in Tucson, AZ.
           My first introduction to coding was when I was 11 years old. My cousin introduced me to a classic game video game (which I still play today) called Ultima Online. I later discovered that the game files
           to create your own server were openly available to anyone, so I downloaded them, and my interest peeked. Ever since then, I've enjoyed coding, along with most other technology. My mother and father 
           had a hand in these interests as well, with my mother being in the I.T. field at the University of Arizona, and my father buying/reselling laptops in the early 2000's. My father would bring home 
           loads of laptops from his auctions and would have me help him load a fresh copy of Windows 95 on to each one of them at a very young age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later on in life, I continued to enjoy coding and technology, but was not sure if it was what I wanted to do for a career. I have always thoroughly enjoyed automotive work as well, so I naturally was 
          considering that as well. However, after a few decision changes, I settled on going to school for Computer Science. As you can tell, I am now pursuing a career in Computer Science, and am very happy 
          with the decision I made. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As for what I have made of my decisions... I have acquired a reasonably broad skillset thus far (with more to come!) My current skillset includes (but is not concluded by):

        <p>As for my schooling, I am currently a senior attending the University of Arizona for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I will be graduating in the Fall of 2019. I like to
        use the free time that I have to better my web development/tech skillset. If you are interested in finding out more about what I have to offer and how I can be a valuable asset to your
