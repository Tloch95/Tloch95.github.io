        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
           My name is Thomas Lochner. I am a web/software developer in Tucson, AZ. I enjoy coding and have received my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Arizona. In my sophomore/junior year, I took a part time
           job as a student software developer at the University of Arizona. I had prior experience to coding, however only academic experience and personal experience from my spare time/side projects. With my
           student developer position, I began developing my professional skillset, learning C#, ASP.NET MVC, SQL, JavaScript/jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Git, Azure, and Entity Framework. I mostly had experience with Java
           from my academic experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          My student developer position was a great introduction to the professional world of coding, and eventually led me to a full-time position as a Business Systems Integration Specialist, again at the University of Arizona.
          This position strengthened the skills that I had previously acquired from my student developer position. I continued to do full-stack web development work, with a bit more focus on some DevOps through Azure, and some more focus
          on data integration via SQL and a data streaming tool called "StreamSets". This position also introduced me to working with Salesforce as we had taken on Salesforce as a new venture. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Business Systems Integration Specialist, I jumped straight into working full-time while I finished up what I had left of my Bachelors degree. Toward the end of my academic career, I moved to a Senior Integration Engineer position, again at the
          University of Arizona. This is the position that I currently hold, and it has greatly advanced my skillset and professional skills. This position has introduced me to the Python programming language, along with AWS and MySQL. I received my Bachelors degree
          in Computer Science with a Minor in Business Administration while I held this position. This position has also introduced me to working with a larger team, going from a team of <10 to working on a team of about 40+. I have taken on much more responsibility
          in this role, and in turn have become a much more valuable asset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a list of the skills that I have acquired through both my professional experience as well as my personal and academic experience:
